This code base represents the work of the members of ZARJ Robotics on the 2017
NASA Space Robotics Challenge.

There was a lot of blood, sweat and tears poured into this code which was all
done under tight time requirements against shifting requirements. So forgive us
sloppy coding and horrible hacks.

We also feel like there is a lot of beauty and really fun solutions to hard
problems where that we would love to share with the interested world.

Cloning this repo is welcome but we will not be managing pull
requests or issues. We consider this code to be for archive and research
purposes only.

Please Enjoy!
